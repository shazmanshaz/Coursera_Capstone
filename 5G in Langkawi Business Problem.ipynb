The population as at 2010 census is 85,588 and density of 180/km2 (460/sq mil).\n\nThe government of Malaysia is rolling out its ambitious 5G plan. Working along side with the major Malaysian private telco companies, they are spearheading the effort to bring 5G in phases across the country.  \n\nDubbed \u2018Isla Nublar\u2019, a fictional island of Jurassic Park, Langkawi is an ideal starting ground for building and testing infrastructure due to its rugged terrain, robust infrastructure, varieties of residential, tourism, commercial, factories administrative and agricultural areas which offer an ideal \u2018sandbox\u2019 environment to build the 5G infrastructure."
